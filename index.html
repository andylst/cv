        <p><em>In an endless search for answers and <strong><a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/ru/search/unicorn">happiness</a></strong></em></p>
        <p>I was born and spent my childhood in a small village. It was a good time. I would hardly have had so much fun in the city. Who knows, though. I studied well at school, but when I moved to a big city, difficulties began. Now I am fond of
          martial
          arts, music and try to understand what I want to do in life. I want to do something useful and meaningful. For society and the planet, no matter how loud it sounds.</p>
